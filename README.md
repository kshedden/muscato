__Muscato (Multi-Genome Scalable Alignment Tool)__

Muscato is a software tool for matching a collection of sequence reads
into a collection of target sequences, e.g. gene sequences.  The
approach effectively scales to hundreds of millions of reads and
target sequences.  A major goal of Muscato is to perform exhaustive
multi-mapping, meaning that each read is mapped to as many gene
sequences as possible, subject to specified match quality contraints.
